When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thought Shield</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it.

You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">witch bolt</span>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eldritch Invocations</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Boon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Metadata\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (6th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (7th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 13th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (8th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.

You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 17th level, you gain a 9th-level warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (9th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 17th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 9th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot.

of the Ancestral Guardian","type":"subclass","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Ancestral Protectors</b></p>\n<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spirit Shield</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Consult the Spirits</b></p>\n<p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components.

It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of your rage.

If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide.

When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><em>5th-level Armorer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Armor Modifications</b></p>\n<p><em>9th-level Armorer feature</em></p>\n<p>You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor’s special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor’s model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfected Armor</b></p>\n<p><em>15th-level Armorer feature</em></p>\n<p>Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guardian.</strong></em> When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.</p>\n<p>You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Infiltrator.</strong></em> Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"armorer","classIdentifier":"artificer","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":65004771,"id":652225,"type":"class","importId":"lvtLV6XxpZEMdMpc"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Armorer"}}},"img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-layered-gilded-orange.webp","effects":[],"_id":"9KVOLfRZKoEHscal","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530789144,"modifiedTime":1675530789144,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Artificer","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Constitution &amp; Intelligence</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d8 per artificer level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: 8</span></strong> + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\"> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons<span class=\"No-Break\"><br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools:</span></strong> Thieves' tools, tinker's tools, one type of artisan's tools of your choice<span class=\"No-Break\"><br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws:</span></strong> Constitution<span class=\"No-Break\">, Intelligence<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Cho<span class=\"No-Break\">ose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Medicine}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Perception}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Sleight of Hand}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"No-Break\">The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&amp;D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the <a title=\"rules on firearms\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms\">rules on firearms</a> in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em> and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Tinkering</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>Infuse Item</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusionsKnown\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusions Known</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “<a title=\"Artificer Infusions\" href=\"#ArtificerInfusions-1131764\">Artificer Infusions</a>” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>\n\n<p><b>Artificer Infusions</b></p>\n<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can’t learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p>\n<p>Unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn an infusion more than once.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ArcanePropulsionArmor\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Arcane Propulsion Armor</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer<br />Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wearer’s walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack’s target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>\n<li>The armor can’t be removed against the wearer’s will.</li>\n<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs—hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"ArmorofMagicalStrength\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Armor of Magical Strength</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor’s charges in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>If the creature would be knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{prone}, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{prone}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<h5 id=\"BootsoftheWindingPath\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Boots of the Winding Path</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer<br />Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see.

In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"EnhancedDefense\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Enhanced Defense</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A suit of armor or a shield</em></p>\n<p>A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"EnhancedWeapon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Enhanced Weapon</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A simple or martial weapon</em></p>\n<p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"HelmofAwareness\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Helm of Awareness</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer<br />Item: A helmet (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing this helmet, a creature has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the wearer can’t be surprised, provided it isn’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</p>\n<h5 id=\"HomunculusServant\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Homunculus Servant</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp</em></p>\n<p>You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it.

Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Right Tool for the Job</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tool Expertise</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.</p>\n\n<p><b>Flash of Genius</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Magic Item Adept</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can attune to up to four magic items at once.</li>\n<li>If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Spell-Storing Item</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.</p>\n\n<p><b>Magic Item Savant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can attune to up to five magic items at once.</li>\n<li>You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Magic Item Master</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul of Artifice</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.</li>\n<li>If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">any two simple weapons of your choice</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">a light crossbow and 20 bolts</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 9, Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 15","identifier":"artificer","levels":8,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"YlRmlnU2Kd7BEWzz","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg","7":"avg","8":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"Yha0U1LUeRiV7XHX","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"infuse-item","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":2},"6":{"value":3},"10":{"value":4},"14":{"value":5},"18":{"value":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Infuse Item"}],"saves":["con","int"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["slt","arc","his","inv","nat","med","prc"],"value":["inv","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"artificer","ability":"int"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":65004771,"definitionId":252717,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"int","importId":"lvtLV6XxpZEMdMpc"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Artificer"}}},"img":"icons/commodities/tech/cog-bronze.webp","effects":[],"_id":"s8SefkzcLBju2bXW","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530789153,"modifiedTime":1675530789153,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Aarakocra","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, evoke fear and wonder.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />+2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom, Flight, Talons</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/621/636286750208925478.png?width=350&amp;height=350&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=95&amp;auto=webp\" />\n\n<p><b>Flight</b></p>\n<p>You have a flying speed of 50 feet.

At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"},"class":"Artificer","subclass":"Armorer","importId":"lvtLV6XxpZEMdMpc"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Artificer"}}},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectiles-star-purple.webp","effects":[],"_id":"pzMccNmZQDz9QxiU","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530789601,"modifiedTime":1675530789601,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Infuse Item","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins—sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not as important as delive<span class=\"No-Break\">ring justice.</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Abjure Enemy. </span></strong>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened}. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a failed save, the creature is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened}, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Vow of Enmity. </span></strong>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oath Spells</b></p>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<h5 id=\"OathofVengeanceSpells\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude compendium-hr\">Oath of Vengeance Spells</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Paladin Level</th>\n<th>Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>bane, hunter’s mark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>hold person, misty step</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>haste, protection from energy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>13th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>banishment, dimension door</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>17th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>hold monster, scrying</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Avenger</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat.

This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul of Vengeance</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>\n\n<p><b>Avenging Angel</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lay on Hands</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the paladin spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} while you are conscious.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura Improvements</b></p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two martial weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) five javelins or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 82, Player's Handbook pg 87","identifier":"paladin","levels":8,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"RLCcSCEORb3IB0dB","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg","7":"avg","8":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"zaOceqBkuO9kZcwW","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"aura-of-protection","type":"number","scale":{"6":{"value":10},"18":{"value":30}}},"value":{},"title":"Aura of Protection"},{"_id":"mpljuPevUvDfISjN","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"aura-of-courage","type":"number","scale":{"10":{"value":10},"18":{"value":30}}},"value":{},"title":"Aura of Courage"}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","rel","ins","med","itm","per"],"value":["ath","per"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":63837466,"definitionId":4,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"cha","importId":"wCobq4gleQw392yq"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Paladin"}}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/weapons-crossed-swords-yellow-teal.webp","effects":[],"_id":"VcnHWafSxgbVBWsr","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530021493,"modifiedTime":1675530021493,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Protector Aasimar","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good.

Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide.

There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.</p>\n<p>Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.</p>\n<p>Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moth;star moths (see the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/aag\">Astral Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.</p>\n<p>Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.</p>\n<p>Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.</p>\n<aside class=\"text--rules-sidebar\" style=\"--compendium-rules-sidebar-color:#A6D6DD\">\n<p>ASTRAL ELVES OF XARYXIS</p>\n<p>The adventure, <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/lox\">Light of Xaryxis</a></em> features an amoral astral elf society called the Xaryxian Empire.

You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94, Player's Handbook pg 97","identifier":"rogue","levels":8,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"MGdqGpDJ6zSu46C6","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg","7":"avg","8":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"WjFzS52BLddKlyGR","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"sneak-attack","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"number":1,"faces":6},"3":{"number":2,"faces":6},"5":{"number":3,"faces":6},"7":{"number":4,"faces":6},"9":{"number":5,"faces":6},"11":{"number":6,"faces":6},"13":{"number":7,"faces":6},"15":{"number":8,"faces":6},"17":{"number":9,"faces":6},"19":{"number":10,"faces":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Sneak Attack"}],"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["ath","acr","slt","ste","inv","ins","prc","dec","itm","prf","per"],"value":["ste","slt","dec","inv"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":75527774,"definitionId":12,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"importId":"7zA8FqKN6zsxTfXd"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Rogue"}}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-sword-stabbed-brown.webp","effects":[],"_id":"KSiKIE7PjcWILscg","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530934733,"modifiedTime":1675530934733,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Dark Elf (Drow)","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />+2 Dexterity, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{Darkvision}, Keen Senses, Fey Ancestry, Trance</p><p>As a drow, you are infused with the magic of the Underdark, an underground realm of wonders and horrors rarely seen on the surface above.

There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.</p>\n<p>Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.</p>\n<p>Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moth;star moths (see the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/aag\">Astral Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.</p>\n<p>Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.</p>\n<p>Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.</p>\n<aside class=\"text--rules-sidebar\" style=\"--compendium-rules-sidebar-color:#A6D6DD\">\n<p>ASTRAL ELVES OF XARYXIS</p>\n<p>The adventure, <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/lox\">Light of Xaryxis</a></em> features an amoral astral elf society called the Xaryxian Empire.

Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide.

See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the cleric spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><caption>\n<h5 id=\"DestroyUndeadTable\" style=\"text-align:left\">Destroy Undead</h5>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Destroys Undead of CR …</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1/2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a mace or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) chain mail (if proficient)</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A shield and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 61","identifier":"cleric","levels":6,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"3pmlGtrKHRJwObBW","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"vfxtxqmB4IMypsMT","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"destroy-undead","type":"number","scale":{"5":{"value":1},"8":{"value":1},"11":{"value":2},"14":{"value":3},"17":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Destroy Undead"},{"_id":"0qejays9aapvinez","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"channel-divinity","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":1},"6":{"value":2},"18":{"value":3}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Channel Divinity Uses"},{"_id":"pxDc5jV9dJLpNTNz","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["his","rel","ins","med","per"],"value":["rel","per"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":66257153,"definitionId":2,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"LLw93wALhK6Bjyj1"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Cleric"}}},"img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Qu3J20FDPEuskn5G","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675530828015,"modifiedTime":1675530828015,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Fairy","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />Fey, Fairy Magic, Flight</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/20476/679/637677615384421492.png?width=350&amp;height=350&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=95&amp;auto=webp\" />\n\n<p><b>Creature Type</b></p>\n<p>You are a Fey.</p>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>You are Small.</p>\n\n<p><b>Speed</b></p>\n<p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fairy Magic</b></p>\n<p>You know the druidcraft cantrip.</p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell with this trait.

To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cantrip Formulas</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level wizard feature</em></p>\n<p>You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112, Player's Handbook pg 116","identifier":"wizard","levels":8,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"aiebS955bckSCkwk","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg","7":"avg","8":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"87B6Xy0bCdddGTau","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","inv","rel","ins","med"],"value":["inv","arc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":65004742,"definitionId":8,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"int","importId":"Xtt71gYhsDeWkV4E"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Wizard"}}},"_id":"qLFhLz0OlU3cNuRJ","img":"icons/magic/air/wind-tornado-wall-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675534625948,"modifiedTime":1675534625948,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Protector Aasimar","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wizard","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":410,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Wizard"},"class":"Wizard","subclass":"School of Divination","importId":"Xtt71gYhsDeWkV4E"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Wizard"}}},"_id":"yrsirTBZwgdz0c9P","img":"icons/magic/light/projectiles-star-purple.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675534626415,"modifiedTime":1675534626415,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Arcane Recovery","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.</li>\n<li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.</p>\n<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Companion</b></p>\n<p><em>2nd-level druid feature</em><br />You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material components.</p>\n<p>When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cantrip Versatility</b></p>\n<p><em>4th-level druid feature</em><br />Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class’s Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.UWw13ISmMxDzmwbd]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as @Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-spells.E7cEMj69id7DEDcj]{<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning}</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ.JournalEntryPage.0RBamBThjzeAdMSt]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n  <p></p>\n</details>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":2,"max":"2","per":"sr","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"attribute","target":"resources.tertiary.value","amount":1},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["@scale.druid.wild-shape",null]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":"1019","entityTypeId":"222216831","componentId":167,"componentTypeId":12168134,"type":"class","class":"Druid","subclass":"Circle of Wildfire","dndbeyond":{"levelScale":{"id":12415,"level":8,"description":"[8th] Max CR 1","dice":null,"fixedValue":null},"levelScales":[{"id":12414,"level":4,"description":"[4th] Max CR 1/2 (no flying speed)","dice":{"diceCount":null,"diceValue":null,"diceMultiplier":null,"fixedValue":null,"diceString":null},"fixedValue":null},{"id":12415,"level":8,"description":"[8th] Max CR 1","dice":{"diceCount":null,"diceValue":null,"diceMultiplier":null,"fixedValue":null,"diceString":null},"fixedValue":null}],"limitedUse":[{"level":null,"uses":1}]},"importId":"eNkjPTiX7Z4QMrIv"},"infusions":{"infused":false},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Druid"}}},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Jt0y46DQG3O6oH0t","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675549575200,"modifiedTime":1675549575200,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Summon Wildfire Spirit","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"As an action, you can expend one use of your <em>Wild Shape</em> feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.</p>\n<p>Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.</p>\n<p>Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moth;star moths (see the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/aag\">Astral Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.</p>\n<p>Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.</p>\n<p>Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.</p>\n<aside class=\"text--rules-sidebar\" style=\"--compendium-rules-sidebar-color:#A6D6DD\">\n<p>ASTRAL ELVES OF XARYXIS</p>\n<p>The adventure, <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/lox\">Light of Xaryxis</a></em> features an amoral astral elf society called the Xaryxian Empire.

Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide.

If your Dungeon Master uses the <a title=\"rules on firearms\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms\">rules on firearms</a> in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em> and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Tinkering</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>Infuse Item</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusionsKnown\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusions Known</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “<a title=\"Artificer Infusions\" href=\"#ArtificerInfusions-1131764\">Artificer Infusions</a>” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"},"class":"Artificer","subclass":"Battle Smith","importId":"6DUDDgN5DfOBoSlV"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Artificer"}}},"_id":"8cFBW67cUVljcY0e","img":"icons/magic/light/projectiles-star-purple.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675531343609,"modifiedTime":1675531343609,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"}},{"name":"Infuse Item","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

It’s common for them to serve aboard spelljamming ships, not only as emissaries of the gods but also as spelljammers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Astral Elves</h3>\n<p>Long ago, some elves ventured to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.</p>\n<p>Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.</p>\n<p>Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moth;star moths (see the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/aag\">Astral Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.</p>\n<p>Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.</p>\n<p>Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.</p>\n<aside class=\"text--rules-sidebar\" style=\"--compendium-rules-sidebar-color:#A6D6DD\">\n<p>ASTRAL ELVES OF XARYXIS</p>\n<p>The adventure, <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/lox\">Light of Xaryxis</a></em> features an amoral astral elf society called the Xaryxian Empire.

See <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Countercharm</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed}. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} ends early if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated} or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Secrets</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Superior Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</span></p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a longsword, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a diplomat’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an entertainer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a lute or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any other musical instrument</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor and a dagger</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 51, Xanathar's Guide to Everything pg 15","identifier":"bard","levels":8,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"3irxZlqhPmSlI3qJ","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg","6":"avg","7":"avg","8":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"Fmsy1sJiL6m23sQl","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"bardic-inspiration","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"number":1,"faces":6},"5":{"number":1,"faces":8},"10":{"number":1,"faces":10},"15":{"number":1,"faces":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Bardic Inspiration"},{"_id":"6xlsKwOO7QdzXWkk","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"song-of-rest","type":"dice","scale":{"2":{"number":1,"faces":6},"9":{"number":1,"faces":8},"13":{"number":1,"faces":10},"17":{"number":1,"faces":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Song of Rest"},{"_id":"vc31v6423jmiex1p","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"inspiration","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"faces":6,"number":null},"5":{"faces":8,"number":null},"10":{"faces":10,"number":null},"15":{"faces":12,"number":null}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Bardic Inspiration Die"},{"_id":"XqVWKlXYIk9A39le","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":2},"4":{"value":3},"10":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"},{"_id":"sZl8eAmx0M2KXdRA","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"spells-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":4},"2":{"value":5},"3":{"value":6},"4":{"value":7},"5":{"value":8},"6":{"value":9},"7":{"value":10},"8":{"value":11},"9":{"value":12},"10":{"value":14},"11":{"value":15},"13":{"value":16},"14":{"value":18},"15":{"value":19},"17":{"value":20},"18":{"value":22}}},"value":{},"title":"Spells Known"}],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ath","acr","slt","ste","arc","his","inv","nat","rel","ani","ins","med","prc","sur","dec","itm","prf","per"],"value":["prc","itm","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":60446182,"definitionId":1,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","isStartingClass":true,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"cha","importId":"IT7IwMrrByeS9lEb"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Bard"}}},"img":"icons/skills/toxins/cup-goblet-poisoned-spilled.webp","effects":[],"_id":"ZkVpLgtdeWIKehal","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"poQgiGVMpGdxsvmb":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675526595501,"modifiedTime":1675526595501,"lastModifiedBy":"poQgiGVMpGdxsvmb"}},{"name":"Monitor","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Similar in appearance to Modrons, these spherical constructs hide a much more advanced form of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increases</b></p>\n<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.
