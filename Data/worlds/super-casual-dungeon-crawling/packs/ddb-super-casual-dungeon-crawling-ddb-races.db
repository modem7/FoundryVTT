House Sivis’s message stations employs these items as the backbone of their long-distance communication network. The house also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders, and others who work with words.

Sivis gnomes are typically friendly, curious, and engaging, but that kindly exterior might conceal a scheming mind. Gnomes have a natural love of intrigue, and the different families within the house often engage in subtle schemes and feuds. Doyenne Lyssa Larriman, the leader of the house, takes pains to ensure that these intrigues never threaten the house or its reputation.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-racial-traits.nOwzbDOAhFLjYURC]{Darkvision}</b></p>\n<p>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Kundarak’s lands in the Mror Holds include deep veins of precious metals, which the dwarves used to establish the banking industry of Khorvaire. Anyone who makes a living from coin—from bankers to goldsmiths—likely learned their skills at House Kundarak. The security of banks bearing the Kundarak manticore emblem is legendary.

The house has no love of renegade dwarves using their marks to turn a profit, and such rogues strive to avoid the eye of Kundarak.</p>\n<p>As the dwarves of the Mror Holds have come into increasing conflict with the daelkyr, Lord Morrikan d’Kundarak has instructed house heirs to establish connections with the Gatekeeper druids.

House Deneith is also renowned for its Sentinel Marshals, agents who hold the authority to pursue criminals and enforce the law across the length of Khorvaire. The Sentinel Marshals hold the honor of the house in their hands. Being a Marshal is a privilege, and it comes with high expectations.</p>\n<p>Despite its might and the desire of some house members to flex their military muscles, House Deneith has always maintained absolute neutrality, selling its services to all sides of a conflict. Baron Breven d’Deneith shows no inclination of using the massive, chi­mera-marked military forces of his house for his own ends, but he’s surrounded by aggressive advisors who would like to see a Deneith ruling all Khorvaire. House Deneith is also caught in an escalating rivalry with House Tharashk, as it edges into the mercenary trade.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

The magic of the mark allows the bearer to keep a place clean, and to heat, chill, and season food. But it also helps the bearer connect with others.</p>\n<h4 id=\"HouseGhallanda\">House Ghallanda</h4>\n<p><strong>Leader:</strong> Yoren d’Ghallanda</p>\n<p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Gatherhold (Talenta Plains)</p>\n<p>The majority of inns, taverns, and restaurants in the Five Nations are either directly owned by House Ghallanda or licensed by its Hosteler’s Guild. Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda’s strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears many things—if you want to know what’s really going on in a community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House Ghallanda don’t sell information; they prefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, they likely have a favor they can call in.</p>\n<p>Ghallanda has a number of “bound businesses”—franchises run directly by the house. The Gold Dragon Inn is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns licensed by House Ghallanda. The blink dog emblem is an assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of health and quality—but not every inn is run by a halfling.</p>\n<p>House Ghallanda’s mandate extends beyond providing creature comforts to travelers. Every one of the house’s enclaves—which are more numerous than those of any other dragonmarked house—is a sanctuary beyond the legal reach of any government or dragonmarked house. Baron Yoren and his daughter Chervina have greatly expanded the house’s presence even in remote areas such as the edge of the Demon Wastes, guided by their study of the Draconic Prophecy.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-racial-traits.jXAkYo3WclWO79xS]{Lucky}</b></p>\n<p>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-racial-traits.UehS1OyGotnKtFxT]{Brave}</b></p>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-racial-traits.1NrgqQNDZLzVNIji]{Halfling Nimbleness}</b></p>\n<p>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increase</b></p>\n<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling.
