See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the wizard spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-class-features.yNhxwp5xVqJdaNMr]{Arcane Recovery}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.

Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>","requiredLevel":3,"displayOrder":9},{"id":268,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

See <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-class-features.fR1beqWOMAx1zI2G]{Bardic Inspiration}</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.

Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4},{"id":462,"name":"Proficiencies","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Herbalism kit<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":2},{"id":534,"name":"Hit Points","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d8 per druid level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":1},{"id":167,"name":"Wild Shape","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-class-features.tMr0vx47hziaGPqG]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-class-features.28tHIFVafsULNO6X]{Infuse Item}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-super-casual-dungeon-crawling-ddb-class-features.zZ1TMkBGcP6hQr1J]{Artificer Infusions}</b></p>\n<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4},{"id":1131631,"name":"Infuse Item","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see &ldquo;<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
