{"type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>A 10-foot-radius @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>\n<p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>charm person</strong>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <strong>fireball</strong>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <strong>wall of fire</strong> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <strong>longsword, +1</strong> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n<p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <br />You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":8,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"other","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"name":"Teleport","flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":138839,"definitionId":2275,"entityTypeId":435869154,"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null},"originalName":"Teleport","sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":281,"sourceType":1}],"tags":["Teleportation"],"version":"3.3.12","effectsApplied":true}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/runes-star-blue.webp","effects":[],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675533443718,"modifiedTime":1677431032511,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_id":"mIXvxxcxivK62ir0"}

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>\n<p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>\n<p>A <strong>remove curse</strong> or <strong>greater restoration</strong> spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 261","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"1","units":"minute"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"save","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":5,"school":"enc","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"name":"Modify Memory","flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":138512,"definitionId":2196,"entityTypeId":435869154,"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null},"originalName":"Modify Memory","sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":261,"sourceType":1}],"tags":["Control"],"version":"3.3.12","effectsApplied":true}},"img":"icons/magic/air/air-burst-spiral-teal-green.webp","effects":[],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675533447827,"modifiedTime":1677431032622,"lastModifiedBy":"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"gRbX7wsbHXsd3tee":3},"_id":"sfH4gxywLatas24x"}
{"type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\n<p>The glyph is nearly @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} and requires a successful Intelligence (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an <em>explosive runes</em> glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
