# Automated Animations
**No animations are provided in this module. It is designed to work in conjunction with the JB2A Animated Assets module. This module has been reviewed, approved and recommended by JB2A**  

I am not affiliated with JB2A, and am working on this only as a side project to make these great animation more easily accesible.
