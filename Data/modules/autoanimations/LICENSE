Code from the module Midi-QOL (https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol) written by Tim Posney has been included in Automated Animations to aid with checking distance between tokens.

Code from the Misty Step Animation was originally created by HoneyBadger (Trioderegion), big thanks for his involvement in the Foundry Community!

Code from Token Magic FX is used and modified to only show Template Grid Highlighting on hover (index.js L229-237). Code is adapated from Secretfire under GPL V3 (https://github.com/Feu-Secret/Tokenmagic/blob/master/LICENSE)
