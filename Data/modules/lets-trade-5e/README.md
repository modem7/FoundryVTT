# Lets Trade 5e
A Foundry VTT module which allows you to send and receive items from other players.

This module was created during the December 2020 Hackathone.

## Features

Allows player characters to trade with one another. Players must be online to trade, and they must have their character selected in the player configuration. Click on the "balance" icon for an item or next to the currency. You will be prompted with the ability to transfer the item or coins to another player character.

The second player must then confirm the trade with a prompt on their screen, at which time, the items or coins will be transferred between the players.
