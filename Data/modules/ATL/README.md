# Active-Token-Effects

Active Token Effects works as active effects for token data. This means any token data can be controlled through an Active Effect: size, lighting, vision, image etc.

You can use the syntax `ATL.X` as the attribute key for the active effect. Where `X` is the data path you wish to change.
For example to change dimSight on a token use `ATL.sight.dim` as the attribute key

There are 3 preset values for torch, lantern and candle. Use `ATL.preset` and value of the name in lowercase `torch`, `lantern`, `candle` and `flashlight`. These will override custom values set in other flags.

Works very well alongside DAE for equip-toggle effects (Goggles of Night for example) or with Midi QoL for consumables (like torches)

## Premade Items

 These are made and (and only compatible with) the dnd5e system, but the syntax will apply across all systems.

## Modes

Modes will act the same as standard active effects. Note that any effect with a non-numeric value, eg light animation, will require OVERRIDE.

## Altering presets or adding new ones

- You can now add to; remove, or alter the existing presets
- In the lighting menu is a plus button to trigger the UpdatePresets command from below
- 4 macro/console commands :
  - ATL.AddPreset() takes 2 arguments, the name of the preset to add and the object to add
  - ATL.RemovePreset() takes the name of the preset to be removed
  - ATL.GeneratePreset() will open a dialog to create a new preset
  - ATL.UpdatePresets() will open a dialog to edit,delete,add presets
- Use the presets in the same way with `ATL.preset` with a value of the preset name.
