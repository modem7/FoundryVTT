        <strong>When and how to transfer module ownership:</strong><br><br>
        * If you have multiple users with GM permission and the user who installed and activated the module is offline, you can take over module ownership. <br/><br>
        * This means that the websocket connection is established with you and not with the previous owner. <br/><br>
        * The primary GM user can take back ownership any time when you are offline.<br><br>
        * Patreon supporter rewards will not be transferred.
