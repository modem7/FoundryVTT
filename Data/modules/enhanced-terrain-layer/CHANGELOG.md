Added the option to get a list of all available terrains.  Thank you Stäbchenfisch the code looks amazing.  Technically nothing should change for the interface, but this improvement can help Rulers be more effecient.

Fixed an issue with how Enhanced Terrain Layer was determining if a token was dead.

Added the option for Rulers to pass in a function to determine if a Token is considered dead or not.  This will allow system specific ruler to change how tokens are considered "dead".

Fixed some styling with the terrain control buttons when the Scene has set the default terrain cost.  Made it more apparent what's happening, and that the buttons are no longer clickable.

Added key binding to toggle terrain showing.  Used Alt-T to switch between states.

Changed the interface for spells/items so that terrain controls will only appear if the spell requires a measured template.  As terrain details aren't needed otherwise.

Changed from using min/max to elevation and depth

Added the option to set custom terrain cost.  So you can set a minimum and a maximum range, and set the value within that range.

Fixed issue with newly created terrain, making a change, then hitting undo. Instead of undoing the move, it was undoing the create.

Allowed tokens causing difficult terrain and dead tokens causing difficult terrain to work idependantly. 

Allow terrain height to use decimal numbers.

Fixed issue where Enhanced Terrain layer was resetting the scroll position after a change.

Merging environment and obstacles so that it's just one list.  But added the option to set an item in the environment list as being an obstacle, so they can still be shown in separate lists.  This fixes issues when using the option to use obstacles with environment.  Setting an obstacle without an environment caused issues.

Adding a side menu to change the environment type from the terrain HUD.

Added integration with spells, so you can set the difficulty, environment, and terrain type of the spell and it will translate to the measured template produced.  Only works for DnD5e right now, but if it gets added to more systems then I'll update it.

Fixed the image path names so that it wasn't hard coded to the enhanced terrain layer folder.  And overriding the environment will now let you override the image used.
