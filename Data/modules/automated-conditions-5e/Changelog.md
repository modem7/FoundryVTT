## v10.0.3
- Quick fix for unlinked tokens.

## v10.0.2 <hl>
 - Closing https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/3: Melee attacks on Prone targets will have advantage when distance <=5, and disadvantage otherwise. 
- Closing https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/4: Added RollDeathSaves. Exhaustion levels 3-5 will grant disadvantage of death Saves.

## v10.0.1 <hl> 
- Closing https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/automated-conditions-5e/issues/1: Using `CONFIG.DND5E.conditionTypes` to fetch effect labels.
- `_getMinimumDistanceBetweenTokens` should respect diagonal movement types (will make sense in the future)

## v10.0.0 <hl> 
- Initial commit
