## 1.7.5
### Translation
- Added Chinese (Simplified) translation (thanks sakusenerio!)


## 1.7.4
### Bug fixes
- Added a workaround for a Foundry VTT bug that could cause Terrain Ruler to freeze the application. The ruler may still behave incorrectly when the bug occurs, but at least the software should no longer freeze. (thanks JDCalvert!)


## 1.7.3
### Bug fixes
- Restored functionality on gridless scenes

### Compatibility
- Removed several deprecation warnings that were emitted by foundry

### Translation
- Added Portugese (Brazil) translation (thanks eunaumtenhoid)
- Updated French translation (thanks vincent)
- Updated German translation
- Updated English strings


## 1.7.2
### Bug fixes
- Added a workaround for a Foundry VTT bug that could cause Terrain Ruler to freeze the application. The ruler may still behave incorrectly when the bug occurs, but at least the software should no longer freeze.


## 1.7.1
### Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug where Ctrl+Drag measurements wouldn't respect difficult terrain in some game systems
- Measuring with the ruler now shows the terrain as it should
- Removed a nonsensical varning that was showing up in the console

## 1.7.0
### Breaking changes
- The deprecated `game.terrainRuler` API endpoint is now being removed. If your module is still using it, switch over to `terrainRuler`.

### Compatibility
- Terrain Ruler is now compatible with Foundry v10


## 1.6.0
### New features
- When measuring with difficult terrain, the terrain layer will now be shown (if the "Show on Drag" setting is enabled in Enhanced Terrain Layer)
- There is now a setting that allows to configure the default state of the terrain ruler toggle after joining a game (possible options: on, off, remember last)
- The Terrain Ruler toggle can now be bound to a key

### Game Systems
- Terrain Ruler now supports the measuring style of "Legend of the Five Rings 5e"

### Compatibility
- Drag Ruler now utilizes libwrapper


## 1.5.1
### Compatibility
- Terrain Ruler is now compatible with Foundry v9

### Translation
- Added french translation (thanks to Elfenduil)


## 1.5.0
### API changes
- There is now an API endpoint for pinpointing the pixel coordinates of given distances along a measured path


## 1.4.0
### API changes
- Measurement options are now passed to the cost function to allow for finer grained control over enhanced terrain layer's behavior (thanks to Michael Clavell!)


## 1.3.2
### Compatibility
- Terrain Ruler is now compatible with 0.8.8


## 1.3.1
### Compatibility
- Terrian Ruler is now compatible with 0.8.6
- Support for the old `TerrainLayer` module has been dropped, as that module has been confirmed to not receive updates for 0.8 compatibility. From now on only `Enhanced Terrain Layer` is supported. That module will now be tagged as a dependency.
- This version drops support for foundry 0.7, to prevent users of the `TerrainLayer` module from updating accidentaly and loosing the `TerrainLayer` support.


## 1.3.0
### New features
- Measuring difficult terrain on gridless maps is now supported ([#11](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-terrain-ruler/issues/11))

### API changes
- Terrain ruler now exposes it's internal state to allow to continue measurements over multiple `measureDistance` calls

### Translation
- Added german translation (thanks CarnVanBeck!)



## 1.2.5
### Other
- The deprecation warning in the console now correctly refers to `game.terrainRuler` instead of `game.terrianLayer`.


## 1.2.4
### API changes
- Terrain Ruler's API now is just called `terrainRuler` instead of `game.terrainRuler`. `game.terrainRuler` will continue to work until the next major release.
- `terrainRuler.getCost` now accepts options that will be passed to the active terrain layer module, if supported.


## 1.2.3
### Compatibility
- Terrain Ruler can now work together with the [Enhanced Terrain Layer module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/enhanced-terrain-layer). The original TerrainLayer module will stay supported for now as well. ([#7](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-terrain-ruler/issues/7))


## 1.2.2
### Compatibility
- Terrain Ruler is now compatible with Hex Token Size Support. For compatibility Hex Token Size Support Version 0.5.5 or higher is required. Thanks to Ourobor for helping making this possible.


## 1.2.1
### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug that made the ruler look broken on gridless maps if Terrain Ruler is installed ([#4](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-terrain-ruler/issues/4))


## 1.2.0
### New features
- Now provides a more accurate path on square grids if measurement isn't done from grid center to grid center (doing this is only possible via other modules that use this module's API)

## 1.1.0
### Game Systems
- Add support for the Pathfinder 2e way of measuring diagonal cost over difficult terrain

### Other
- Changes that allow Drag Ruler to better integrate Terrain Ruler


## 1.0.1
### Bugfixes
- Terrain Ruler no longer blocks other tools ([#3](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-terrain-ruler/issues/3))

## 1.0.0
Initial release
