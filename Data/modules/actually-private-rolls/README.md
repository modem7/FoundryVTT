# Actually Private Rolls

Enforces private rolls to be invisible with no new message notification. This also silences private rolls (removes dice roll sounds) by proxy.

Includes option to keep blind rolls partially visible to author, default enabled, to avoid issues with uncertainty of the roll happening.

✅ If you like private rolls being super private, this is for you.
